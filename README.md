<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
<h3> Section 1: Submitting a Ticket as an End User </h3>

</p>
<p>

  - To begin the project, I simulated a real-world support request by submitting a ticket as end user "Karen" through the osTicket Support Center.
  - I filled out the Contact Information section with Karen's credentials.
  - I selected "Report a Problem" as the help topic, indicating that this issue was related to a technical issue.
  - In the ticket details, I reported an issue where users were unable to access the online banking portal.

</p>
<br />

<h3> Section 2: Categorizing the Ticket as Support Staff </h3>

</p>
<p>
  
  - Next, I logged into the Support Center as staff user "John", who is responsible for reviewing and managing incoming supprt tickets.
  - I reviewed the issue reported by the end user and confirmed that it qualified as "business-critical outage".
  - I updated the Help Topic to better reflect the nature of the issue.
  - Because a business-critical outage is a high-severity issue, I classified the SLA plan as Sev-A.
  - I assigned the ticket to the Online Banking department, as the issue pertained to access problems with the online banking portal.

</p>
<br />

<h3> Section 3: Assigning the ticket to a Specialist </h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>

  - After the ticket was routed to the Online Banking department, I logged in as staff member "Jane Doe", a member of that team, to review the ticket.
  - After reviewing the ticket, I assigned it to myself to begin addressing the issue.

</p>
<br />

<h3> Section 4: Updating the end user and Resolving the issue </h3>

</p>
<p>

  - Given the severity of the issue, I propmptly updated the end user "Karen" with my initial diagnosis, explaining what I suspected to be the root cause of the issue.

</p>

</p>
<p>

  - After determining the cause, I simulated real-world ticket resolution by updating the end user with the actions that were taken to resolve the issue.
  - I closed the ticket after confirming the issue was resolved and no further action was needed.

</p>
<br />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Working through this ticket lifecycle helped me better understand the process of how help desk operations function in a professional environment. From identifying critical issues to communicating with end users and assigning tickets based on team structure, this project has better prepared me for real-world IT support workflows.
